# Predicting-Board-Game-Reviews-Using-KMeans-Clustering-Linear-Regression

Board games have been making a comeback lately, and deeper, more strategic boardgames, like Settlers of Catan have become hugely popular. BoardGameGeek is a popular site where these types of board games are discussed and reviewed.
Here we have a dataset that contains 80000 board games and their associated review scores. The data was scraped from BoardGameGeek and compiled into CSV format by Sean Beck.

The dataset is stored in board_games.csv, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ThaWeatherman/scrapers/blob/master/boardgamegeek/games.csv).
